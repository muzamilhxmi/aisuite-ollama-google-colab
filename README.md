[![Tutorial Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUR_VIDEO_ID/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID)

Welcome to the **AI Model Comparison Notebook** repository! This project features a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to compare various AI models using Ollama, integrated with AIsuite and Gradio. Run the notebook on Google Colab with free GPU support for an interactive and efficient experience.

## Overview

In this notebook, you'll:
- **Compare Multiple AI Models:** Evaluate outputs from models such as `llama3.2:1b`, `smollm2:135m`, `phi3`, `tinyllama:latest`, and `gemma2:2b`.
- **Experience an Elegant UI:** Use a sleek Gradio interface that organizes each model's output into separate, easily navigable tabs.
- **Leverage Google Colab:** Utilize free GPU support to accelerate model testing and demonstration.
- **Integrate AIsuite Tools:** Enhance your workflow with additional functionalities provided by AIsuite.

Whether you're new to AI or an experienced practitioner, this notebook offers a user-friendly approach to exploring state-of-the-art AI models.

## What's Included

- **AI_Model_Comparison.ipynb:** The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and interactive demos.
- **requirements.txt:** A list of all the Python packages needed to run the notebook.
- Additional configuration files and resources as needed.

## How to Run

### Using Google Colab
1. Open the notebook directly on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Ensure GPU is enabled by navigating to *Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU*.
3. Run the cells sequentially to interact with the models via the Gradio interface.
